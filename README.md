# CozyWait
The smart restaurant waiting list

CozyWait replaces paper waiting lists at restaurants.

If you eat at restaurants a lot, you'll love the app because instead of waiting around
for your name to be called, you'll just get a text message when a table opens up.

If you own a restaurant, you'll love the app because it makes managing waiting lists really easy,
reduces no shows, and creates happier customers that are more likely to come back.

You can find a full working demo at http://cozywait.firebaseapp.com.

The app uses these technologies:

* AngularJS 1.4.x
* Firebase 2.2.x
* AngularFire 1.1.x
* Bootstrap 3.3.x
* Zapier
